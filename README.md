# Image-Denoising-by-using-MPI
In this project, i have used parallel programming with C/C++ using MPI library. I implemented a parallel algorithm for image denoising with the Ising model using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The Ising model, named after the physicist Ernst Ising, is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be in one of two states (+1 or -1).
